IN the present file, the basic CURD operations are clarified for reference:

1. Replace the "dabase name" with your databse name in every operation
2. All_in_one file contains all the CURD operation.
3. "rowcount.php" file is only a sample of using php PDO methods.
4. "db.php" file describes the connection of database serever.
5. No need to define database connection in every file, just simply include the 'db.php" file using
    include("db.php");
   function in php.



Thank You.
